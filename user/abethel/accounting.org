List of what everything in the repository does, part of my effort to
refactor our use of Docker to be more consistent and simpler.

* Scripts

  |---------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+------------------|
  | Script name                           | Independent | Uses compose | Purpose               | Is depended upon |
  |---------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+------------------|
  | ros/shell.sh                          | Y           | N            | Shell for building    | N                |
  | webots/webots-tmp-test.sh             | Y           | N            | Webots on empty world | N                |
  | docker-scripts/rosterm                | Y           | N            | Shell on webots\under{}ros   | N                |
  | docker-scripts/setup\under{}simulator\under{}config | N           | N            | Calls services        | N                |
  | docker-scripts/start\under{}sim              | Y           | Y            | Starts simulator      | Y                |
  |---------------------------------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------------+------------------|

  Scripts vary widely in terms of how they are implemented. In
  particular, the Docker scripts that don't use Compose each use long
  manual invocations, each of which as slight variations in its use.

  Some scripts can be run independently, whereas other scripts require
  that certain other scripts are currently running.

* Dockerfiles

  |--------------------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------------|
  | File name                | Expected name       | Contents                                          | Use                     |
  |--------------------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------------|
  | ros/Dockerfile           | lunabotics-2023-ros | ROS, ROS nodes, ROS tools, dev tools              | simulator.yml, rviz.yml |
  | webots/docker/Dockerfile | webots\under{}ros          | Webots, ROS, Webots-ROS, ROS nodes, Webots config | simulator.yml           |
  |--------------------------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------+-------------------------|

  These dockerfiles contain a bit of repetition. Note that the Webots
  dockerfile installs ROS on top of the docker.io Webots image.

* Compose files

  |---------------+----------------------------+-------------|
  | File name     | Purpose                    | Contents    |
  |---------------+----------------------------+-------------|
  | control.yml   | Running control computer   | ROS         |
  | robot.yml     | Running robot computer     | ROS         |
  | rviz.yml      | Connecting RViz to ROS     | RViz        |
  | simulator.yml | Running simulator setup    | ROS, Webots |
  | telem.yml     | Running telemetry computer | -           |
  |---------------+----------------------------+-------------|

  I like us having different compose files for different roles of
  computers. Don't like the fact that some compose files depend on
  others: rviz.yml depends on simulator.yml or potentially one of the
  other ones running.

  rviz.yml could possibly be almost completely auto-generated. The
  only distinctive features of rviz.yml are:
  * Requires the built `ros` image.
  * Calls the program `rviz`.
  * Connects to `ros-docker-net`.
  And other than that, it's used as a program that's invoked once
  rather than as a daemon that runs in the background.

  Some computers need slightly different setups to get Docker working:
  specifically my computer and some Ubuntu computers I've used aren't
  compatible with the `services.<name>.deploy` option, because their
  GPUs don't work well with Docker. We should have a capability for
  machine-specific configuration that can declare whether to include
  this string in every file. Also, my machine doesn't have xhost
  installed; could just install xhost via Nix, or could have another
  config option for it.
